 </header>

I am an enthusiastic learner, currently studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo.
I particularily enjoy learning the beauty of mathematics and its applications!

As a hobby, I enjoy playing <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" style = "color :#3399ff">Go</a> 
and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing" style = "color :#3399ff">speedcubing</a> (Personal Best 3x3: 24.13s).
I have also played piano for 11 years and you can check out my favorite
